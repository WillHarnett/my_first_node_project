# Step 1
We are going to simply setup our package.json file and the index.js file for the node application
1. If you are using In terminal navigate to the root folder for this project (if you followed previous steps it should be the My_First_Node_Project folder)
2. In terminal paste: npm init
3. You should get prompted to fill out some information, the only thing you need to add for now is the name of the package which we will set as: My_First_node_project
4. After you set the package name, just hit enter until the prompt exists. You should see that a package.json file has been created now in your current directory
