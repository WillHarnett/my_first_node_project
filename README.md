# my_first_node_project
This is not a project for QA in order to setup a standalone project to run tests
This is inteded to show you how to setup the following:
 - A node Project to learn the basics about node and programming in js
 - Visual Studios Code basics
 - Making API requests and parsing responses
 - Creating tests and test suites using the Unit testing framework "Jest"
 - Simple load testing (for sanity tests)Â¥
 - Selenium

## Setup
First lets get setup to use the following:
 - Homebrew
 - Node
 - Git

### Mac
1. Open up a new terminal
2. Paste the following to install homebrew: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" 
      --- here is the website with instructions in case this fails: https://brew.sh/
After homebrew installs paste the following commands into terminal to install git, node, Visual Studios Code
3. brew install git
4. brew install node
5. brew install visual-studio-code
Next we are going to setup the folder to hold all of our code and file. I terminal we are going to do the following 
6. cd
^^^This brings you to your home directory if you weren't already there
7. mkdir My_First_Node_Project

## Next steps
 - Open Visual Studios Code (VSCode) <<< or your preferred IDE >>> and open the folder you created above in step 7
 - If you are using VSCode, you can actually use VSCode to run terminal commands. Just press down the following keys to bring up the terminal: Control Shift ~

All of the following steps are under the steps folder starting with folder Step_1. 
In each Steps folder there is completed code for that step and there is a Steps file to walk you though how to get your own code/folder to look like each Step
Steps will gradually get larger/more complex as they go along as you should be getting more familiar with how node works
